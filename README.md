# framework-challenge
Lab for creating a page based off of sharpen.design generator.
Instructions

Take a screenshot of the site showing your prompt text so you have a record.
Select a CSS Framework you'd like to use. You may use any of the four we covered this week or choose your own from the many available.
Follow the lab requirements below to complete the challenge.

Note: this is just an example, you can refresh and choose whatever prompt you'd like. You may have better luck if you filter by "Products &  UX" as this will generate less branding and marketing prompts.

Lab Requirements
Create a new GitHub repository called "framework-challenge" and sync it with Codespaces/your development environment.
Create a new index.html file and any other supporting directory structure for your framework (you can use the boilerplate here).
Complete the prompt using the CSS framework of your choice.
Remember to validate your HTML using the W3C Validator.
Save, commit, and push your project to GitHub and deploy to Netlify.
Submit your Github repo link and public Netlify URL to D2L.
